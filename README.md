# Fii-coding-challenge

Hello! this is the coding challenge.

To get the app up and going first you must clone this repo and then download https://yarnpkg.com/ if not already installed. This is a package installer

Second you are going to want to cd into the hello-world folder in your command line and then run 'yarn add' to install all of the 
dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, please run 'yarn server' to open up the local host server of the front end and then please go to 
http://localhost:8080/ to view the page.
